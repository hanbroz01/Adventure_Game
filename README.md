# A Knight’s Mission

A text-based adventure game built in Python, played entirely in the terminal.  
The game focuses on branching logic, state management, and user-driven progression.

Players navigate a magical forest, make strategic decisions, collect items, and face random encounters in order to rescue the Queen. Certain paths and encounters require specific items to progress, resulting in multiple win and loss conditions.

## Key Features
- Branching narrative with player-driven choices
- Inventory-based progression system
- Randomised creatures, weapons, and locations
- Terminal-based user interaction with timed output
- Multiple endings and replay support

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Standard library only (`random`, `time`)
